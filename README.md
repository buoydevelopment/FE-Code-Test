A) Describe the strategy used to consume the API endpoints and the data management.

Simple fetch getting the data, then updated the state.

B) Explain which library was used for the routing and why. Would you use the same for a consumer facing app targeting thousands of users? Why?

React-Redux it's production ready, lot's of documentation and examples.

C) Have you used any strategy to optimize the performance of the list generated for the first feature?

Nope, If we have a real API we can page the results, and then update the list accordingly(pull to refresh).

D) Would you like to add any further comments or observations?

Sorry, didn't have enough time to finish all the thing I wanted to.
